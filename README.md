<h3>Description</h3>
The web app allows users to search for multiple GIF's by title using the giphy API. searches are saved throughout the browser session for the user to come back to. GIFs are stopped/animated by clicking on the images. Additionally, when a GIF is animated, the user is given the options to share the URL or bookmark the GIF for later use. 

Additonally, the app uses lazy-loading to continually query for additonal search results by accessing the giphy API when the user reaches the end of the currently displayed search results.
